# Food-related-information
Mobile augmented reality (AR) application designed to enhance users' understanding of food by providing functional, sustainable, and affordance-based information in real time.


## Purpose and Goals

- Educate users about the **nutritional benefits**, **sustainability**, and **alternative uses** of food items.
- Promote **behavioral change** by influencing users’ dietary decisions through immersive AR experiences.
- Bridge gaps in existing nutrition apps that focus narrowly on **calorie counting** or **weight loss**.

  Users scan food items using their phone camera. The app overlays digital information such as:
  - Nutritional benefits (e.g., vitamins, antioxidants)
  - Sustainability indicators (e.g., packaging, sourcing)
  - Affordances (e.g., alternative uses like skincare or cleaning)

- **Barcode Recognition**  
  Retrieves product-specific sustainability data.

- **Interactive UI**  
  Offers intuitive navigation with clear visuals, icons, and menu options for exploring food-related insights.
